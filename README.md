# Java-OOP-ShootingGame
Object Oriented Design Patterns Practice with Java. Implement factory, Strategy, Singelton, Observer, etc. design patterns.
The goal of this project is to use object-oriented software development skills learned in class to develop a simple Asteroid Game.
The game area will have floating shapes which generated from ‘json’ file. The player can use keyboard to control a space ship and the ship can fire shots. 
If the shots hit shapes, the shape will explode. If the shape hit shapes, the player ship explodes. A score panel will count the overall score for player. Each player has 3 ship life.
